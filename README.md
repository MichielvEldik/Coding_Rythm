# Coding_Challenges
Mostly ProjectEuler for now, but will get started on data structures and algorithms from HackerRank some time soon.
In these challenges, it's not my only goal to get the right answer. 
It's also a goal to learn something new about Python by being open to implementing ideas and theories in a way that is foreign to me.
